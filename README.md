# Atlas - The Public Think Tank  

> A social media platform connecting innovative thinkers with keen problem-solvers.  [(Pre-Launch Landing Page)](https://atlas.thepublicthinktank.com/)

## Overview  

Atlas is a social media platform designed to connect innovative thinkers with problem-solvers. It provides a space for users to share ideas, collaborate on projects, and engage in meaningful discussions. The platform aims to foster a community of forward-thinkers who can collectively address complex challenges.  

It is built with ASP.NET Core MVC for the backend and utilizes Entity Framework Core for data access. The platform is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.  

> Note: This version is intended for a CPTC Spring Quarter release and is a multi-page app.  
> This app is built and tested on Google Chrome (The Blink rendering engine)
> A potential future version of this project (CPTC Summer Quarter) may see this project ported over to Blazor for a Single Page App user experience.
