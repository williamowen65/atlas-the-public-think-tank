            <p>
  This idea came to me while I was <b>studying to become a social worker</b>. I was learning how to help people navigate real challenges—mental health, financial strain, housing, relationships—and I began to notice something. <b>So many of the solutions already exist</b> in the world, but they're hard to find, disconnected, or buried beneath bureaucracy and noise.
</p>

<p>
  That’s when a <b>lightbulb went off</b>: what if modern web technologies—especially the connective power of social media—could be used to <b>actually solve problems</b>, not just scroll past them?
</p>

<p>
  I started sketching out ideas. Wireframes. Mockups. I shared the concept with friends and the public. As the vision became clearer, I realized I <b>couldn’t rely on someone else to build it</b>. I needed to pause everything and <b>learn how to develop the site myself</b>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>This site is the result of that decision.</b>
</p>

<p>
  While today’s social media is often framed as <b>addictive or even harmful</b>, it’s also proof that <b>humans crave connection</b>. I believe we can <b>reimagine these platforms to be more intentional—more helpful</b>. The mainstream options are limiting us. <b>This project is my attempt to explore what could come next.</b>

            <div class="question">

            <div class="desc">What you’re trying to do, and why it matters</div>

            <p>
  <b>The purpose of this website</b> is to organize solutions to problems—big or small—by giving people the tools to think clearly, collaborate openly, and share ideas meaningfully.
</p>

<p>
  Many problems in the world feel too large or too tangled to solve. But often, what holds us back isn’t a lack of ideas—it’s a lack of structure. <b>This platform is designed to help break complex issues into smaller, solvable parts</b>, and to allow people to engage with the parts they care about or understand best.
</p>

<p>
  It’s also a space for <b>creativity and expression</b>, especially for voices that don’t always get heard. If someone has a great idea—whether they're young, old, experienced, or just starting out—I want them to have a way to put that idea into the world and see how it fits into a larger solution.
</p>

<p>
  This isn’t just a static site—it’s a <b>living, evolving project</b>, and even the app itself is treated as an “issue” that can be improved over time. People can contribute ideas, suggest changes, or even fork the project entirely.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Transparency matters</b> here, so the app is fully open-source—you can read the code, reuse it, or help build it. And because <b>safety matters</b> too, I also plan to integrate AI-powered content moderation, so that meaningful conversation is protected from harm while staying open and inclusive.

  <b>All content on this platform is voted on using a 0–10 scale.</b> This is a major shift from mainstream social media algorithms, which typically rely on simple upvotes and downvotes.
</p>

<p>
  A score of <b>0</b> means something like "<i>This is a bad idea</i>" or "<i>This is not an important issue</i>." On the other end, a score of <b>10</b> means "<i>This is a great solution or issue—more people should be talking about this</i>."
</p>

<p>
  <b>Each piece of content displays three key metrics:</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>The average score</b> based on all votes</li>
  <li><b>Your personal score</b>, if you’ve voted</li>
  <li><b>The total number of votes</b> the content has received</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This voting system encourages <b>more nuance and thoughtfulness</b>, helping prioritize content not just based on popularity, but on quality, impact, and relevance.
