            answer: `
            <p>
            This idea came to me while I was studying to become a social worker. I was learning how to help people navigate real challenges—mental health, financial strain, housing, relationships—and I began to notice something. So many of the solutions already exist in the world, but they're hard to find, disconnected, or buried beneath bureaucracy and noise.
            </p>
            <p>
            That’s when a lightbulb went off: what if modern web technologies—especially the connective power of social media—could be used to actually solve problems, not just scroll past them?
            </p>
            <p>
            I started sketching out ideas. Wireframes. Mockups. I shared the concept with friends and the public. As the vision became clearer, I realized I couldn’t rely on someone else to build it. I needed to pause everything and learn how to develop the site myself.
            </p>
            <p>
            This site is the result of that decision.
            </p>
            <p>
            While today’s social media is often framed as addictive or even harmful, it’s also proof that humans crave connection. I believe we can reimagine these platforms to be more intentional—more helpful. The mainstream options are limiting us. This project is my attempt to explore what could come next.
